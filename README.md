# Delaware North Data and Analytics Recruiting Project 2022-05-10

## Overview
The US Department of [Health and Human Services][hhs] provides federal-level
collection and publishing of COVID-19 testing and patient outcome data. To 
better understand the current state of COVID-19 testing in the US, weâ€™d like you
to create a Python project and documentation for the following metrics:

- The total number of PCR tests performed as of yesterday in the United States.
- The 7-day rolling average number of new cases per day for the last 30 days.
- The 10 states with the highest test positivity rate (positive tests / tests
  performed) for tests performed in the last 30 days.

For each of the above, please provide:

- The Python code that yields the desired metric
- A report/output that communicates the metric results
- A brief description of the metric presented and any insights you've gleaned from this metric. Be sure to include any caveats and context that should be communicated to stakeholders to aid in their interpretation. 

## Details

We expect this exercise to take approximately five hours to complete. Please keep in
mind that dates used in your Python code should be dynamic.

## Submission

To submit your completed project, please send us a link to a git repository
that includes your Python code, data output, and metric documentation. We recommend 
submitting your documentation in a Markdown file to aid in readability during review.
We will send a confirmation email upon receipt and schedule a feedback follow-up
call to discuss your results. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you
have any questions.
